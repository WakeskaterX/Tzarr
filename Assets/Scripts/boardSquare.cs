		*	Board Squares are clickable squares that are normally invisible on the board.  Players can click them instead of a unit to select the unit on that square.
		*   When the unit on that square is selected board squares light up blue for places that the player can move that piece to and red for pieces the player can attack.
		*   Players then select a board square to move the piece to that square.
		*	Board Squares also store the data of the piece above them in them
